7/1/24: got the game working, at least the structure of it, things that need to be done next are that for the preflop,
we need to make sure that the big blind has the opportunity to raise but make sure that if the big blind raises then the
 action will close not on the big blind but on the small blind because right now thats what is being done but it doesnt
 work for the first table round of betting for the preflop, also need to add changes to players balances when they bet,
 raise, and fold, also create a game ledger that records every action taken instead of printing it to
 the console, also get the cards rolling out (use the array in the hand class)

 7/5/24: finished pushing to files, got the cards rolling out, fixed preflop, changed balances, ledgers all done,
 created text file of all the hand rankings, finish evaluation of hand next time then start coding two basic bots, the
 first bot will play solely off its cards and the board, the second bot will play off its cards, the board, and the
 actions of other players

7/6/24: finished evaluation of hands, just have to go over small edge cases when chops occur in a flush, trips, two
pair, pair, and high card, finish this next time and then start creating the first bot

7/7/24: finished chop cases and incorporated them into program, there is a bug where if two people fold in the same
round (especially when bb folds) there is an exception thrown in the folded players array because of removing players,
debug this error next time and start creating bot in python
