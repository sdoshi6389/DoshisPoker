assuming a 7 player game, so table = sb bb utg lj hj co d

preflop hand consideration: know strength of own hand and strength of position

sb bb utg positions are weak, should fold or raise, very rarely just call unless getting the right price

lj hj positions are ok, can call in many situations and start loosening up hand range

co d positions are strong, can call in almost all situations if getting the right price, hand range can be a lot looser
based off the action preflop

weak positions should have around 15% raising range, 30% calling range
ok positions can have around 30% raising range, 50% calling range
strong positions can have around 40% raising range, 70% calling range
(make sure to add a factor where even if a hand isnt in ones hand range, they still have a small chance of playing it)

figure out what draws you have based on the board and your hand and what the strength of your opponents hand could
possibly be

create an equity calculator which compares two hands and sees how much equity you have versus those hands, could also
compare multiple hands against each other

based on the equity calculations, calculate what your expected win or loss would be based off of what you have predicted
 other players hands could be and see if you are getting the right price to call, should you fold, or raise

based on hands you think other players have, create arrays of scare cards or cards that you should be cautious to if
they come on the next street
